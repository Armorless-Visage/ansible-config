# Configure Thresholding and Suppression
# ======================================
#
# The threshold command is deprecated.  Use detection_filter for thresholds
# within a rule and event_filter for standalone threshold configurations.
# Please see README.filters for more information on filters.
#
# Thresholding:
#
# This feature is used to reduce the number of logged alerts for noisy rules.
# This can be tuned to significantly reduce false alarms, and it can also be
# used to write a newer breed of rules. Thresholding commands limit the number
# of times a particular event is logged during a specified time interval.
#
# There are 3 types of event_filters:
#
# 1) Limit
#    Alert on the 1st M events during the time interval, then ignore
#    events for the rest of the time interval.
#
# 2) Threshold
#    Alert every M times we see this event during the time interval.
#
# 3) Both
#    Alert once per time interval after seeing M occurrences of the
#    event, then ignore any additional events during the time interval.
#
# Threshold commands are formatted as:
#
# event_filter gen_id gen-id, sig_id sig-id, \
#     type limit|threshold|both, track by_src|by_dst, \
#     count n , seconds m
#
# Limit to logging 1 event per 60 seconds:
#
# event_filter gen_id 1, sig_id 1851, type limit, \
#     track by_src, count 1, seconds 60
#
# Global Threshold - Limit to logging 1 event per 60 seconds per IP triggering
# each rule (rules are gen_id 1):
#
# event_filter gen_id 1, sig_id 0, type limit, track by_src, count 1, seconds 60
#
# Global Threshold - Limit to logging 1 event per 60 seconds per IP triggering
# any alert for any event generator:
#
# event_filter gen_id 0, sig_id 0, type limit, track by_src, count 1, seconds 60
#
# Suppression:
#
# Suppression commands are standalone commands that reference generators and
# sids and IP addresses via a CIDR block (or IP list). This allows a rule to be
# completely suppressed, or suppressed when the causitive traffic is going to
# or comming from a specific IP or group of IP addresses.
#
# Suppress this event completely:
#
# suppress gen_id 1, sig_id 1852
#
# Suppress this event from this IP:
#
# suppress gen_id 1, sig_id 1852, track by_src, ip 10.1.1.54
#
# Suppress this event to this CIDR block:
#
# suppress gen_id 1, sig_id 1852, track by_dst, ip 10.1.1.0/24
